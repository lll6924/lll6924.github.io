I am a PhD student in Computer Science at University of Massachusetts Amherst, working with Professor [Daniel Sheldon](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sheldon/index.html), expecting to graduate in 2026. Previously I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from Tsinghua University in Beijing, where I worked with Professors [Dan Pei](https://netman.aiops.org/~peidan/) and Jiaxing Song. I am actively looking for 2025 summer internship opportunities. Please reach out to me if you think I am a fit to your position!

Research Preferences
======
My research preferences lie on statistical methods in machine learning. Recently, I am working on
+ Approximate Inference Methods （Variational Inference, Markov chain Monte Carlo, Sequential Monte Carlo）
+ Probabilistic Programming (especially based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo)
+ Generative Models (Diffusion Model, Normalizing Flow)
+ Simulation Based Inference (for Scientific Applications)

Other
======
I "made up" some interesting problems in algorithms during my high school and undergraduate. I am actively translating and posting them [here](/algorithms/).
