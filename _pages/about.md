I am a PhD student in Computer Science at University of Massachusetts Amherst, working with Professor [Daniel Sheldon](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sheldon/index.html), expecting to graduate in 2026. Previously I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from Tsinghua University in Beijing. 

Research Preferences
======
My research preferences lie on probabilistic machine learning, computational statistics and Bayesian inference. Recently, I am working on
+ Approximate Inference Methods (Variational Inference, Markov chain Monte Carlo, Sequential Monte Carlo)
+ Probabilistic Programming (especially based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo)
+ Generative Models (Diffusion Model, Normalizing Flow)
+ Artificial Intelligence for Sciences (Scientific Simulators, Computational 
  Ecology)
