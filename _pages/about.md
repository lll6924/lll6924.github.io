I am a second year MS/PhD student in Computer Science at University of Massachusetts Amherst, working with Professor [Daniel Sheldon](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sheldon/index.html). Previously I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from Tsinghua University in Beijing. In Fall 2018 and Spring 2019, I worked on VAE with flow prior at [NetMan](http://netman.aiops.org) with Professor [Dan Pei](https://netman.aiops.org/~peidan/). In Spring 2020, I worked on Off-Policy Evaluation with Multiple Behavior Policies with Professor Jiaxing Song.
