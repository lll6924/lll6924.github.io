I realize that the papers I write are usually dense with convoluted ideas. It might be better to accompany them with more concise blogs. In this column I will share some writings about my research.

### [(TODO) Delta method for important sampling variances](/posts/delta_method)

### [(TODO) Augmented model and augmented inference: why should they work?](/posts/augment)

### [(TODO) "Marginalization" from different perspectives](/posts/marginalization)
