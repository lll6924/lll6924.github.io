I used to identify as an algorithmic novelist, a term that recently found its way into my thoughts. Despite the ever-expanding and evolving landscape of literature, its essence remains unwavering: the captivating artistry of human expression through words. In tandem with one of humanity's most remarkable achievements, algorithms have progressed significantly, broadening the boundaries of linguistic possibility. It's conceivable that a novel form of literature could emerge from the realm of algorithms, provided we can articulate and deeply appreciate their inherent beauty.

Mathematicians have displayed their prowess in composing mathematical novels. A notable instance is Donald Knuth's "Surreal Numbers," which not only stands as a literary work but also catalyzed the development of an intriguing branch within Game Theory. While I personally consider myself an amateur enthusiast of algorithms, I'm eager to utilize this platform to share my earlier concepts surrounding algorithmic novels. These compositions tend to be concise and accessible to a high school audience. I sincerely hope that you find these ideas stimulating and engaging.

On a side note, the process of translating these concepts into English and refining them further demands a significant investment of time. Juggling numerous other interests only adds to the equation. I kindly ask for your patience in the event that you're anticipating these creations.
