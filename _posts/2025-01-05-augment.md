This post will be about the perspective of augmented variational inference 
for many well-known methods. 

Outline:
- Variational inference
- Augmented VI and why it works
- The framework of estimator-coupling pairs
- The meta-program of augmented VI
- The connection between augmented VI and pseudo-marginalization
