title: "Delta method for important sampling variances"
permalink: /posts/delta_method/
---

This post is mainly about one technique I used in my 
undergraduate dissertation, which mainly follows and 
slightly extends [1].

Outline:
- Self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS).
- Variance estimation for SNIS.
- Covariance estimation for SNIS.
- Variance estimation for sum of SNIS estimators.
